Requirements Analysis and Specification Document

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Purpose
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The presented document is the Requirements Analysis and Specification document
 (RASD) for the MyTaxiService platform project.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main purpose of this document is to analyze the problems that the new
 system is to solve and the customer's necessities, to identify use cases
 and actors, to describe the functional and non-functional requirements
 of the platform along with existing constraints, and to propose an in-depth
 specification of the system before moving on to the more concrete design
 phase.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This document is intended for stakeholders, software engineers, and programmers
 and is to be used as reference throughout the whole development of the
 system.
 Each phase of the project must be brought on with this document in mind,
 and any implementation of the system must be clearly designed to reflect
 the specifications presented here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The secondary audience for this document includes system maintainers and
 developers who wish to integrate the platform's services within their own
 software.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Scope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The aim of this project is to create the MyTaxiService platform, a web based
 information system to manage the taxi service of Pallet Town.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of the platform is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
To provide users with a web application and a mobile application, with which
 to easily make use of the town's taxi service.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
To provide taxi drivers with a mobile application, with which to manage
 customers' requests (submitted through the above mentioned systems)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In short, the platform is to be an integrated infrastructure to manage the
 initial interaction between customers and taxi drivers, to aid the former
 in requesting a taxi ride, and to enable the latter in managing such requests.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The platform will therefore be used exclusively to support the town's taxi
 service, and is aimed at making the taxi request process much efficient
 by reducing overall costs, communication overhead and potential requests
 overloads.
