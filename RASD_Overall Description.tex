\section{Overall Description}

\subsection{Product Prespective}

The system requirements mainly depends on the web technology necessary to communicate between actors 
(taxi, customer, guest) and the GPS due to locate the taxi customer in the specific sector and also to create the taxi queue. 
The central node system need a server (connected on the web) to elaborate the requests and store the users and taxis information. 
The end-user system relies on the guest operating system (usually a mobile OS like Android, iOS, Windows Phone, blackberry OS, \ldots) 
on the internal GPS system and Internet connection. Of course, all the overall system should only work inside the city.
