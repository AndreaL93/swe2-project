\begin_layout Standard
The presented document is the Software Design document (SDD) for the MyTaxiServi
ce platform project.
 The main purpose of this document is to be a guideline for the concrete
 implementation of the platform, provide developers with high level descriptions
 of the main algorithms, describe the architectural styles and patter, and
 generally establish the design standards for the development phase.
 This document is intended for stakeholders, software engineers, and programmers
 and must be used as reference throughout the whole development of the system.
 The secondary audience for this document includes system maintainers and
 developers who wish to integrate the platformâ€™s services within their own
 software.
 The design choices listed here must be respected throughout the whole developme
nt of the platform and any other further expansion of the codebase.

The descriptions listed in this document define the design language that
 must be used by design stakeholders, and implement the

 philosophy.
 These design standards represent constraints to the development of the
 codebase, with all unspecified design decisions left to the developers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Key reasons for the design language described in this document are: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
To facilitate the development, integration, expansion and maintenance of
 the platform.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
To define a business identity (kept consistent in UX and marketing design).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
To implement the requirements listed in the RASD of the project in a consistent
 way.

\shape italic
they
\shape default
, which will be used to refer to single persons throughout the whole document.

\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following section contains a schema of the hardware infrastructure,
 which represents the main operational components of the back-end and their
 relations.
 The high-level software components run on each piece of hardware (or possibly
 the generic hardware's function) are indicated below each node.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For clarity's sake, it was decided to omit the representation of the purely
 network-related hardware (routers, switches, etc.).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The chosen architecture is a typical web-based client-server architecture,
 with the following components: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Main server array: typical rack of servers dedicated to run the main back-end
 logic.
 The rack is composed by independent nodes managed by usual load balancing
 technology, where each node is equipped with the full stack of operational
 software and its dependencies (as listed in sec.
 2.1.1 of the RASD) and is able to be fully functional under average load
 of the system.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
The redundancy of the rack has the dual function of improving fault tolerance
 and performance under above-average load conditions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This node is connected to:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Web server (through firewall): from which the communication to and from
 the users happens.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
DBMS servers: either primary or secondary (the connection is transparent
 to the node and is hot-swappable in the event of a failure).
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Main DBMS server: server dedicated to run the DBMS software on account of
 the main server array and to manage the communication with the secondary
 storage node.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
This node is connected to:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Main server array: from which it receives requests.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Storage: either primary or secondary (the connection is transparent to the
 node and is hot-swappale in the event of a failure).
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Secondary DBMS server: server dedicated to run the DBMS software and manage
 the backup requests from the primary DBMS server.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
The node is connected to the secondary storage and to the primary DBMS sever,
 for the reasons described above.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Primary and secondary storage: typical long term-storage technology on which
 the operational database is saved.
 The primary storage is the node with the highest R/W speeds and is used
 under normal operational regime, whereas the secondary is the most reliable
 one (in terms of long-term storage) and is fully operational only in the
 even of a failure on the primary storage or DBMS nodes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Web server: server dedicated to run the web server software and manage the
 communication between the users and the back-end.
 It is connected to the main server array and isolated by firewalls to implement
 a DMZ and minimize the risk of unauthorized access to the main back-end
 components (especially to the storage nodes).
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
This is the main gateway node of the back-end and is the one exposed to
 the outside world.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Any communication between the user-side apps and the back-end happens through
 the standard Internet protocol.
