\begin_layout Section
Overall Description
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Product Perspective
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The platform aims at replacing the traditional means of communication between
 taxi drivers and customers, and it is therefore designed as a stand-alone
 entity that is able to operate with a minimum set of dependencies towards
 external systems.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The external interfaces on which the system relies, in order to be operational,
 are described in the following subsections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
System Interfaces
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Google Maps API: used in both the back-end and the taxi-side applications,
 this free API is necessary to elaborate routes and display maps.
 The system interacts with the API through standard GET requests.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
GPS: this well known system is required by the mobile applications to get
 information about the users' position.
 The interaction happens through the standard GPS protocol.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
User Interfaces
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Hardware Interfaces
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Router: the internet connectivity of the back-end system towards the external
 world is managed by a physical router that automatically manages ports
 and resources in order to realize standard communication protocols such
 as NAT and DHCP.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Firewall: access to the back-end system is protected through the use of
 a professional grade physical firewall which is directly linked to the
 router and automatically allocates ports and resources.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Device support: the back-end system is designed to be run on usual server
 hardware with a high fault-tolerance degree and supports hardware scaling
 (such as replication); the mobile applications are designed to be run on
 ARM based architectures; the user-side web application does not have specific
 hardware requirements, since it relies on a different level of abstraction
 than its mobile counterpart which is not to be taken into account in the
 design of the hardware infrastructure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Software Interfaces
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
GNU/Linux Red Hat Enterprise Linux: operating system run on the back-end
 that acts as a virtualization level between the hardware and the software.
 Detailed documentation about the software can be found at https://access.redhat.c
om/documentation/en/red-hat-enterprise-linux/
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Apache WebServer: software bundle run on the back-end, which is used to
 allow interaction between the back-end system and the user-side application.
 It is used to handle standard HTTP requests from the customer-side web
 application and to provide CGI services (Apache Module mod_cgid - https://httpd.
apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_cgid.html) to all the user-side applications.
 Detailed documentation about the software is found at https://httpd.apache.org/do
cs/2.4/
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
SQLite: DBMS software component run on the back-end, which is used to store
 user data in a non-resource-intensive fashion.
 Detailed documentation about this module is found at https://www.sqlite.org/docs.h
tml
