Overall Description
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Product Perspective
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The platform aims at replacing the traditional means of communication between taxi drivers and customers, and it is therefore designed as a stand-alone entity that is able to operate with a minimum set of dependencies towards external systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The external interfaces on which the system relies, in order to be operational, are described in the following subsections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Software Interfaces

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Google Maps API: used in both the back-end and the taxi-side applications, this free API is necessary to elaborate routes and display maps. The system interacts with the API through standard GET requests.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Mnemonic: elaborate routes and display maps 
\end_layout

\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
GPS: this well known system is required by the mobile applications to get information about the users' position. The interaction happens through the standard GPS protocol provided by the OS of the users' devices.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Mnemonic: get information about the user position

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Apache WebServer: software bundle run on the back-end, which is used to allow interaction between the back-end system and the user-side application. It is used to handle standard HTTP requests from the customer-side web application and to provide CGI services to all the user-side applications.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Device support
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Device support: the back-end system is designed to be run on usual server hardware with a high fault-tolerance degree and supports hardware scaling (such as replication); the mobile applications are designed to be run on ARM based architectures; the user-side web application does not have specific hardware requirements, since it relies on a different level of abstraction (web browser) than its mobile counterpart which is not to be taken into account in the design of the hardware infrastructure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
User interface
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Memory constraints
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is assumed that enough memory will be provided to the system in order to scale in relation to the user traffic. More details on the topic will be provided in the following sections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Product functions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fully developed platform should implement the following high level functions.

Customer-side application: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
User Characteristic
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As per the definitions given in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Definitions,-acronyms,-and"

\end_inset

 the respective applications are targeted to their respective markets: these consist of any citizen of the town for the customer-side applications, and of any recognized taxi driver for the taxi-side application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Customers do not need specific competences to use the app other than a basic knowledge of web browsing (customers only) and of their mobile operating system (both customers and taxi drivers).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Domain Assumptions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taxi licenses databases

\begin_layout Subsection
Actors and Functionalities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The platform may have different functional and non-functional requirements based on the user that is interacting with it. Throughout this document, the set of these different requirements has been referred to through the terminology specified in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Definitions,-acronyms,-and"

\end_inset

 (e.g. taxi-side application, customer-side application, etc.).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section is aimed at further formalizing the definition of those requirement, based on the different actors that participate in the use of the platform: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
A1 Guest
\series default
: any person who wishes to start a session with the platform through one of the user-side applications. A1 may:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Register a profile into the platform 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Login into the platform 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
After completing a login, A1 actors may become either of the two following types of actor.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
A2 Customer
\series default
: a person as defined in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Definitions,-acronyms,-and"

\end_inset

. Based on what actions A2 completes, they can be further specialized in:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
A2.1 Logged-in Customer
\series default
: an A1 actor who simply logged in to the platform with a customer profile. A2.1 may:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Issue a taxi request 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
View and edit their profile 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
A2.2 Passenger
\series default
: an A2.1 actor who requested a taxi. A2.2 may:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Cancel or edit the previously issued taxi request 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Issue a taxi report 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
A3 Taxi driver
\series default
: a person as defined in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Definitions,-acronyms,-and"

\end_inset

. A3 may:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Handle (accept or refuse) a taxi request issued by an A2 actor. 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Edit their availability status 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Issue a customer report 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Notify a problem 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Requirements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Non functional requirements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The non functional requirements for the platform have been identified as follows: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
NF1 Reliability: the system must satisfy the functional requirements with 100% of server uptime on the back-end side, and a stable release of the user-side applications.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
The latter is achieved through constant maintenance of the applications' code bases (outside of project scope), while the former needs to be designed since the beginning of the project as it relies on specific hardware infrastructures; these include:
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Server farms replication through cloning
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Local data duplication with RAID controllers 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Data synchronization between the server farms 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Periodic memory backup on flash storage to allow for faster recovery in the event of unexpected system failures 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
These measure should minimize the RTO and RPO parameters making them tend to zero.
